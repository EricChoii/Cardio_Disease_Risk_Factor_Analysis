# Cardio_Disease_Risk_Factor_Analysis

Cardiovascular disease is one of the most frequent diseases that threaten people’s health problems. Discussing the relationship between different factors which might cause cardiovascular disease might help us to prevent it. For example, whether there is a relationship between age, smoke, alcohol and cardiovascular disease? These questions could be extremely useful when examining the relationship between different pieces of information related to the disease.
In brief summary, this report will reveal the positive relationship between age, alcohol, tobacco intake, and cardiovascular disease. Also, the analysis will show it is a genetic disease, and 50% percent of patients have a family history. Finally, people with cardiovascular disease will have higher systolic blood pressure between the range of 4.07 mm Hg and 12.48 mm Hg compared to healthy people.
Background
For this project, we chose to work with the Cardiovascular Disease data set which was submitted by Yassine Hamdaoui on Kaggle. It recorded detailed information collected through medical examinations from a larger data set in 1983. The larger original cardiovascular disease data set consists of 462 observations with 10 variables. The data set is a retrospective sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa. And the full data set was described in Rousseauw et al, 1983, South African Medical Journal. The detailed source is: Rousseauw, J., du Plessis, J., Benade, A., Jordaan, P., Kotze, J. and Ferreira, J. (1983). Coronary risk factor screening in three rural communities, South African Medical Journal 64: 430–436. ElemStatLearn, R-Package.

The data set has 10 variables, but we will only focus on the following key variables:
sbp: systolic blood pressure
tobacco: cumulative tobacco (kg)
famhist: family history of heart disease, a factor with levels “Absent” and “Present”
alcohol: current alcohol consumption
age: age at onset
chd: response, coronary heart disease

### Data limitations declaration:
Due to the original data being only retrieved from high-risk heart-disease areas in Africa, the geographical limitations may affect the interpretation of results. But by analyzing the data from the high-risk areas, the significant relationships between features can be found.

The remainder of the report will examine the following questions:
Is there a relationship between age and cardiovascular disease except all the other factors?
Is there a relationship between alcohol, tobacco intake and cardiovascular disease except all the other factors?
Is cardiovascular disease a genetic disease? If so, is there significant evidence showing that 50% of patients have a family heart disease history?
What is the difference between the average range of systolic blood pressure for a healthy person and a patient?
